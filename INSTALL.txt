Suggested steps:

1) Install Anaconda (unless you already have Python)

2) Create a virtual environment for Keras

  conda create --name keras python=3

3) Activate the virtual environment

  source activate keras

4) Install Keras (and other useful packages)

  pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt


5) Run existing code

  python starter.py

  Warnings:
  
   - This code was developed on MacOS, so if you are running on
     Windows you will need to fix forward slashes to backward slashes
     in file names

6) (if possible) Switch to GPU mode.  This only applies if you have
access to a recently released NVIDIA GPU.  This can significantly
speed up training time.
